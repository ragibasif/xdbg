# xdbg

An extremely minimal memory debugger written in standard C (C99) and uses GNU Make for building. The goal of this project is to provide a very lightweight memory debugging library that can be included in any C/C++ project to aid in debugging dynamic memory allocation. It works by defining macros that replace calls to `malloc`, `realloc`, `calloc`, and `free` and tracking and logging them to be able to catch memory leaks.
